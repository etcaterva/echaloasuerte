=============
Echaloasuerte/ChooseRandom is a simple website that allows people to take
decisions base on random factors.

It gives you random numbers, chose an random element from a list, flip a coin to
the air, etc... and one of the nicest features is that several people can see
the result at the same time, which make the site great to perform draws with
people that are not physically together.

This version is a rewrite of the old site.
